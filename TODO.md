Todo list:

==============================

Convert code into C from C++ to make the algorithm more compact for embedded systems.
Support multiple data types.
Make compatible across arduino versions and for more general usage outside the arduino platform if possible
Replace SHA-256 with more secure algorithm as cryptography inevitably evolves in the future.
